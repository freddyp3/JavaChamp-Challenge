# JavaChamp Challenge  

## What will the application do?

**JavaChamp Challenge** is an application that tests users' Java knowledge. There are three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Each section consists of 5 timed multiple choice from a pool of questions with the difficulty of the category chosen. **JavaChamp** also tracks and saves the userâ€™s top score for each difficulty level, allowing users to monitor their progress and improve over time. If a quiz is closed midway, the application automatically saves progress, so users can resume from where they left off.

## Who will use it?

JavaChamp is for everyone interested in Java. Whether you are a **student** or a **professional Java developer**, this app provides a fun and engaging way to reinforce and test your Java skills.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

This project interests me because I am a kinesthetic learner and quizzes are a great way to strengthen Java concepts through active practice. Additionally, developing this application will provide valuable experience in Java programming making it an exciting and educational project.

## Phase 4: Task 3
In my UML diagram I just want to state that big green C = Class and the big purple I = **<<Inteface>>**

1. **Extract Quiz State Management**: Currently, the Quiz class handles multiple responsibilities including managing questions, tracking scores, and maintaining quiz state. This could be refactored by extracting the state management into a separate QuizState class that would handle the currentScore, index, and answers. This would better follow the Single Responsibility Principle and make the Quiz class more focused on its core functionality of managing questions and difficulty levels.

2. **Implement Strategy Pattern for Question Types**: The Question class currently only supports multiple-choice questions however if in the future I want to add different type of questions it would be complicated to do so. A better design would be to create an abstract Question interface and different concrete implementations (MultipleChoiceQuestion, TrueFalseQuestion, etc.). This would make it easier to add new question types in the future.

These changes would make the code easier to maintain and more flexible for future updates. The downside is that the code might look a bit more complex at first, but the better structure and modular design will be worth it in the long run.
